# Electric Vehicle Allocation
 The project aims to address the growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in Australia, where the adoption of EVs is steadily increasing. With the limited availability of public charging stations and the need for efficient long-distance travel, there is a pressing need to develop a system that can simulate EV charging allocation and balancing along popular routes, such as from Sydney to Melbourne and cities in between.
